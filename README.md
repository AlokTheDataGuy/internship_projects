## Getting Started

Each project has its own README with specific setup instructions. Generally, the projects follow this pattern:

1. Set up a Python environment
2. Install dependencies from requirements.txt
3. Install Ollama and pull required models (for LLM-based projects)
4. Set up the backend server
5. Set up the frontend application

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9+
- Conda (recommended for environment management)
- Ollama with Cogito:8b model installed

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AlokTheDataGuy/chatbot-analytics-system.git
cd chatbot-analytics-system
```

2. Create and activate a conda environment:
```bash
conda create -n chatbot_analytics python=3.9
conda activate chatbot_analytics
```

3. Install the required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Make sure Ollama is running with the Cogito:8b model:
```bash
ollama run cogito:8b
```

### Running the System

1. Start the complete system (both chatbot and dashboard):
```bash
python main.py
```

2. Or run components individually:
```bash
# Run only the chatbot
python main.py --mode chatbot

# Run only the dashboard
python main.py --mode dashboard
```

3. Access the interfaces:
   - Chatbot: http://localhost:7860
   - Dashboard: http://localhost:8501

## üìä System Architecture

The system consists of three main components:

1. **Chatbot Interface**: Built with Gradio, provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the AI
2. **Analytics Dashboard**: Built with Streamlit, visualizes interaction data and metrics
3. **Database**: SQLite database for storing conversation history, feedback, and session data

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **LLM**: Cogito:8b via Ollama
- **Frontend**: Gradio (chatbot) and Streamlit (dashboard)
- **Database**: SQLite
- **Data Visualization**: Plotly
- **Data Processing**: Pandas

## üìù Notes

- The system automatically creates a database if one doesn't exist
- Sample data is shown in the dashboard if no real interactions are available
- All user interactions are logged for analytics purposes
- The dashboard can be refreshed to see the latest data
